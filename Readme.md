# HealthTech App: Gesture-Based Healthcare Solutions

This repository contains a health tech solution that integrates **gesture-based controls**, **AI-powered diagnostics**, **real-time vitals monitoring**, and **secure telemedicine features** to enhance accessibility and efficiency in healthcare.

## Features
- **Gesture-Based App for Patients**: Allows users with mobility impairments to interact with the healthcare system using intuitive gestures.
- **Web Dashboard for Doctors**: A real-time platform offering AI-powered diagnostics, patient monitoring, and meeting management.
- **Smartwatch Application**: Tracks vitals such as heart rate, providing real-time alerts and health data monitoring.
- **Generative AI for Prescriptions**: Uses AI to generate personalized prescriptions based on symptoms and patient history.
- **Telemedicine Integration**: Includes secure video consultations, appointment scheduling, and **push notifications** for reminders, updates, and alerts.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: For building the gesture-based app and smartwatch integration.
- **Python**: For backend AI models and prescription generation.
- **Firebase**: For real-time data storage, authentication, and push notifications.
- **APTOS Blockchain**: For secure, decentralized patient data management and ensuring privacy.
- **Node.js**: For connecting the web dashboard and backend services.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: For diagnostics and prescription generation.
